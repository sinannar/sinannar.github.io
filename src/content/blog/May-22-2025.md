Exciting news. I have two talks scheduled for August.

First talk will be at [Junior Dev Auckland](https://www.meetup.com/juniordev-auckland). I am planning to talk about [Dotnet Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire). I already start planning the talk. Talking about the importance of running applications locally is the heart of conversation. Presentation will start showing what the application we are going to play around, then I will show what it takes to run it. Then we will either compare aspired version of the application or will integrate to aspire during the demonstration.

Second talk will be at [Auckland Kubernetes](https://www.meetup.com/auckland-kubernetes). I will take that the aspired microservices application I build earlier, at previous talk, will use [aspirate](https://github.com/prom3theu5/aspirational-manifests) to create K8S deployment yaml. We will need a K8S cluster to deploy this application tho, so for that we will go a bit of crazy. Instead of using any tool ready on our fingertips, we will deploy our own cluster in a way no body should do on production. I am planning to create 3 ubuntu containers running on docker, then use them as VM Nodes for K8S cluster to create K8S. For this, I am planning to go easy and use [k8s from snap](https://github.com/canonical/k8s-snap). We will deploy our K8S cluster then deploy aspired application to cluster, then add couple of more nodes and scale the app.

Here is the prompt I put on ChatGPT, to get some name suggestions for K8S presentation:

Will put more update when I have.
