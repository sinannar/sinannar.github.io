I am planning to write weekly blogs about dotnet, azure, angular and maybe AI. I am also planning to make demonstrations about what I am talking at the blog following after the blog is released. Like the first topic is starting with `dotnet cli`. I have plans to cover the following topics:
- dotnet cli
- using docker containers
- dependency injection
- options pattern
- using sql and nosql databases
- automapper, mediatr, fastendpoints, fluent* packages
- semantic kernel and Open AI models
- azure resources and how to deploy them
- infrastructure as code
- azure devops and github actions

With the videos, I want viewers to be able to replicate what I talk and do because it is going to be following previous blog post with some maybe extras.
