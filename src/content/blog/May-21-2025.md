Why would you leave your current job?

- You have a bad manager?<br>
- Language bariaer became a barier<br>
- Not having a good team lead is a reason<br>
- Team is not backing you up<br>

I think these are the negative reasons. Are there anything positive?
- Everything is opposite of above<br>
- Better money<br>
- Leaner structure<br>
- More experience<br>

That would work...

This is placeholder. Will try to write about dotnet, aspire, azure, k8s, api management, containers...
